## CRITICAL GAME ECONOMY INSIGHTS (From Enam EnJay Jay)

### New Player Economy Reality

- **CORE FACT:** New players will NOT TT profit long-term
- **REQUIREMENT:** Markup is mandatory for survival or unlimited credit card
- **Expected Return:** ~89-90% with 0 looter + 60 efficiency guns (heavily penalized)
- **Player Rule:** Haven't TT'd anything except animal/robot oil residue for 2.5 years
- **Bankroll Rule:** Maintain 5-10k kill bankroll minimum

### Loot System Mechanics

- **Looter Skill:** Contributes 7% to total loot (maxed at 100)
- **Efficiency:** Contributes 7% to total loot (maxed at 100)
- **Problem:** New players get severely penalized with low looter/efficiency
- **Historical Context:** Old loot system was exploitable with high-efficiency equipment; completely scrapped

### Space Travel Safety

**CRITICAL:** Don't take stackable items when traveling planet-to-planet

- **Safe:** Ammo, Mindessence, non-tradeable items only
- **Routes (NO loot between):** Caly ↔ Foma/CP/Aris/Setesh
- **Dead Zones:** Foma (dead), CP markup (dead), Setesh (noob area)
- **Important:** Aris is the only route of significance

---

## ARIS ECONOMY - HIGH PRIORITY CONTENT

### Aris Progression Path (Recommended Grind)

**First Daily Mission:** Newbie mob mission

- **Reward:** 2x Aris vouchers
- **Requirements:** ~20p cycle per attempt
- **Markup:** Vouchers sell to other players at ~3p per piece + armor

**First Robot Instance:**

- **Loot:** Adjusted Catalyst (8-10p) drops 1-6 pieces at a time
- **Loot:** Improved Catalyst (90-100p) per piece currently
- **Ultra Loot:** 8-15k PED worth of UL weapons (rare chance)
- **Value:** VERY profitable, doesn't take much time
- **Return:** Free TP back to Calypso after completion

### Aris Revenue Model (Current Practice)

- **Daily Grind:** 8-10 vouchers per day
- **Time:** ~1 hour
- **Cycle Cost:** ~400 PED
- **End Goal:** Final robot boss requires: good DPS, armor, plates, FAP chip, resto chip

---

## WEAPON PROGRESSION STRATEGY

### Budget-Friendly Options (Low Markup Focus)

**AVOID:**

- Non-high efficiency guns (hard to resell without massive losses)
- ArMatrix guns at low levels (bad investment, difficult resale)
- UL guns at low efficiency levels (avoid early)

**RECOMMENDED:**

1. **Hyperion Crafted Weapons**

   - Plasma or Gauss (not Laser/BLP)
   - Use Laser amps on them
   - **ADVANTAGE:** Half decay compared to ArMatrix
   - Cost-effective if markup comparable to ArMatrix

2. **Mindforce (MF)**

   - Universal ammo or Synthetic MF ammo
   - No markup on shooting (only implant markup)
   - Chips: Low markup, last long
   - Mayhem MF-amps: Cheap
   - **Use Case:** When gearing up early

3. **Token Weapons**

   - Daily tokens from mission terminal
   - **ONLY DO IF:** Bonus mission (20 tokens) OR already hunting that mob
   - Regular missions not worth effort

4. **Weapon Progression Path (Actual Example)**
   - Laser pistol → BLP pistol → BLP rifle → Laser pistol → Laser rifle
   - BLP = bit more punch at lower levels, cheaper "meh" amps, worse efficiency/DPP
   - Laser = better efficiency, more expensive amps

### Extenders/Attachments Strategy

**ArMatrix Extender P20 (L)** - MANDATORY

- TT Value: ~105-106% typically
- **Takes:** ~20% of gun decay from gun, rest goes to extender
- **Benefit:** If extender markup < gun markup, ALWAYS use it (true for ArMatrix)
- **Pro Tip:** Buy full TT, resell at 30-50p markup, regain majority of markup spent
- **Bonus:** Helps efficiency slightly

---

## SKILLING & LEVELING MECHANICS

### Level Matching System

- **Evade/Dodge:** Increases when skill level matches mob level
- **Bonus Max:** +5 levels above mob
- **Goal:** +5 levels avoids damage, reduces healing/armor decay
- **Graduation Requirement:** ~10 PED of Anatomy skill (1.5-2k PED cycled)

### Optimal Skilling Mobs

- **HP/Level Ratio:** Lower is better for skill gain
- **Excellent:** Arrets on Cyrene (20 HP, Level 4 = ratio 5)
- **Good:** ~20 HP/Level ratio
- **Decent:** ~30 HP/Level ratio
- **Note:** Good leveling mobs usually have trash loot (no markup compensation)
- **Instances:** Available for most skilling mobs (peaceful grinding)

### Graduation Paths (No Rush)

- **Primary:** Anatomy skill (easiest)
- **Alt:** Mining/Engineering (harder, worse)
- **Skill Pills:** Work in favor; use them
- **Timeline:** Happens naturally, no rush needed

---

## DAILY MISSION STRATEGY

### Token-Based Missions

- **Bonus Missions:** 20 tokens (WORTH DOING)
- **Regular Missions:** 5-10 tokens (only if hunting anyway)
- **Priority:** High token missions over low

### Non-Token Daily Missions (Better Return)

- **Return:** ~3% TT in universal ammo
- **Rewards:** Blazar, Nova, Skill Pills (chance), Ares Rings (chance)
- **Effort:** "Pain in the ass" but worth it
- **Reputation:** Markup opportunities exist

### Next Island (NI) Dailies (Advanced Players)

- **Return:** ~5% TT (best available)
- **MAJOR ISSUE:** No market on NI
- **Requirements:** Significant bankroll, warp ship logistics
- **Process:** TT losses OR multiple trips to sell
- **Outdated:** Old herb box farming no longer viable

### Aris Voucher Farming

- Most profitable mission series currently available
- Combines reasonable cycle cost with high loot potential

---

## ARMOR & DEFENSE

### Martial Harness

- **Drops:** Female and Male variants (M,L) limited
- **Cost:** Better to buy used than craft
- **Type:** Impact, Cut, Stab resistance with enhancement slots
- **5B Plates:** Increase durability significantly
- **Note:** Limited (L) means pieces run out, need replacements over time

### Divine Intervention Chip

- **Grind:** Kill all divine mobs across galaxy
- **Reward:** Chip with 0.03 ME + 0.012 decay cost
- **Use:** Survival chance = 0.4 Pec

---

## COMBAT MECHANICS & GLOBALS

### Traeskeron Events

- **Matriarch Event:** Team kill worth 138 PED (recent observation)
- **Hall of Fame:** 23 PED Chelydra Arm Guards recorded
- **Wave Events:** Periodic community hunts
- **Sand King Boss:** 7 phases, extremely deadly (1-shot kills)
- **Spawning Pools:** Regular event location

### Profitable Mob Targets

- **Spina Workers:** Young/Mature - consistent small globals (50-280 PED)
- **Traeskeron:** Good HOF potential with groups
- **Atrox:** Young maturity solo-able, good returns
- **Proteron Young:** Wave event farming viable
- **Hogglo:** Weak maturity available, minimal damage

### Team Dynamics

- **Shared Loot:** Splits all drops among team
- **Tax Lands:** Check before hunting (affects profitability)
- **Territory:** Some players protective but no rules against shared hunting

---

## LANDOWNER INSIGHTS (From Heceleon - EntropiaFund Manager)

### Land Economics

- **Large Area (LA) Cost:** ~220k PED (varies by planet)
- **Expiration:** Flat/Shopkeeper combo ~3.5-4k PED
- **Alternative:** Buy flat near TP + use shopkeeper for lower cost shop setup
- **Natural Spawn:** Lands have natural mob spawns + placed DNAs
- **Creature Management:** Terminal controls which DNAs active

### Land Operations

- **Manager Role:** Marketing, taxes, events, streamer contracts
- **Income:** % of tax collected
- **Expenses:** High when adding services (TP, crafter, auctioneer, etc.)
- **DNA Cost:** Trox DNA example = 15k PED
- **Events:** Race-to-first-global, hunting challenges, mining events

### Winter Park (EntropiaFund NewBie Land)

- **Purpose:** Newbie training ground
- **Creatures:** Low-level spawns (Chirpy, Gibnib, etc.)
- **Features:** Multiple TPs, crafter, auctioneer
- **Tax:** Low to attract farmers
- **Revenue:** Mining events, mob hunts pay bonuses

### Royal Club (EntropiaFund Main Hub)

- **Status:** 24/7 populated, streamers frequent
- **Rebuilt:** Recovered from abandoned state after conflicts with streamers
- **Importance:** Most populated area, community center
- **Growth:** 3 streamers simultaneously documented (2025-10-15)

---

## NEW PLAYER OPPORTUNITIES - AI QUESTS

### AI-Driven Quest System (NEW)

- **Location:** Camp Icarus, Half Moon Cove, Port Atlantis
- **Difficulty Order:** Icarus → Half Moon Cove (most difficult, team recommended)

---

## SPACE MINING DISCOVERY

### Space Mining Economics

- **Entry:** TT space mining laser (learning tool)
- **Skill Issue:** Difficult without proper weapon skills
- **Rare Wins:** Player hit 87,351 PED global in space (ATH-worthy)
- **Current Status:** Experimental, not reliable income

### Asteroid Globals

- Recent massive ATH (87k+) brought attention
- Market impact: Ore inflation from asteroid tailing system
