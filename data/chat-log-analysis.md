   - Calculate ROI by weapon/armor loadout
2. **Crafting Profitability Dashboard:** Shrapnel as primary craft metric
   - Cost basis (materials)
   - Sale price tracking
   - Volume optimization
3. **Global Event Feed:** Display live high-value hunts/crafts

   - Filter by creature type
   - Show top players
   - Identify trends

4. **Economy Timeline:** 3-month rolling view of market activity
   - Loot value trends
   - Crafting cost tracking
   - Markup opportunity identification

### Data for Implementation

- **87 unique valuable craft events** in 3.5 months = ~25/month major crafts
- **1,615 high-value hunts** = ~462/month qualifying hunts (average 20k+)
- **Peak value:** 183k crafts, 81k hunts show ceiling for profit potential
- **Consistency:** Spread across entire period suggests stable economy
