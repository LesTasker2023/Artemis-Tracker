## Game Economy & Changes

### Recent Economic Shifts

- **Space Mining Introduction (2025)**: Asteroid globals now exist but disrupted ore market
- **Tailings System**: Asteroids drop tailings → convert to ores (including rare ones) → massive ore inflation
- **Loot System Overhaul**: Completely scrapped old loot system to close profitability loopholes
- **Market Degradation**: Market worse for past 2 years, traditional activities no longer profitable
- **Old Activities Impact**: Things that used to drop 50p/day now worthless due to ore inflation

### New Player Retention Improvements

- New Starter Pack (major improvement over old one)
- Setesh starter area (released couple weeks prior to chat date)
- Starting Pistol: 80 efficiency, ~10 DPP initially (later nerfed)
- Daily missions: 3-5% TT return (non-token dailies)
- Next Island (NI) dailies: ~5% return (requires bankroll + travel logistics)

## Loot System Math

### Loot Formula (Research-Based)

- **Looter Skill**: Contributes 7% to loot (maxed at 100)
- **Efficiency**: Contributes 7% to loot (maxed at 100)
- **New Player Impact**: With 0 looter + 60 efficiency guns = ~89-90% expected return (heavily penalized)

---

## Equipment & Loadout Strategy

### Gun Selection

**Avoid for Budget Players:**

- Non-high efficiency guns have terrible market
- ArMatrix guns: Hard to sell without massive losses
- UL guns at low levels: Bad investment (difficult to resell)

**Budget-Friendly Options:**

1. **Hyperion Crafted Weapons**

   - Plasma or Gauss (instead of Laser/BLP)
   - Use Laser amps on them
   - Advantage: Half decay compared to ArMatrix
   - Cost-effective if similar markup

2. **Mindforce (MF)**

   - Universal ammo or Synthetic MF
   - No markup on shooting (only implant)
   - Chips: Low markup, long-lasting
   - Mayhem MF-amps: Pretty cheap

3. **Token Weapons**
   - Daily tokens from mission terminal
   - Only do daily missions if: Bonus mission (20 tokens) OR already hunting that mob
   - Regular missions not worth the effort

### Extenders/Attachments

**ArMatrix Extender P20 (L)**

- ~105-106% TT (usually)
- Takes ~20% of gun decay
- If markup lower than gun markup, always use it
- Helps efficiency slightly
- Popular resale for F2P: Buy TT, resell at 30-50p for higher markup

### Armor

- Graduated 5B plates recently acquired
- Armor selection depends on graduation planet (Earth Shock Trooper armor exists with crit damage bonus)

## Skilling & Leveling

### Key Skilling Mechanics

**Level Matching:**

- Evade/Dodge increases when skill level matches mob level
- Bonus maxes at +5 levels above mob
- Minimizes healing/armor decay when evaders are +5 levels above mob

**Skill Gain:**

- Based on mob level, not damage dealt
- Good skilling mobs: HP/Level ratio ~20
- Decent: ~30
- Excellent: Arrets on Cyrene (20 HP, Level 4 = ratio of 5)

**Graduation Requirements:**

- ~10 PED of Anatomy skill needed
- ~1.5-2k PED cycled on good/ok skilling mobs
- No rush - happens naturally
- Skill Pills work in favor
- Alternative paths: Mining/Engineering (harder/worse)

### Skilling Mob Characteristics

- Low HP/Level ratio preferred
- Usually have trash loot (no markup compensation)
- Instances available for peaceful grinding without running
- Can hunt without markup concerns if optimizing for skill gain

## Daily Mission Strategy

### Token-Based Daily Missions

- 20 tokens for bonus missions (worth doing)
- 5-10 tokens for regular missions (only if hunting anyway)
- Minimal effort vs reward trade-off

### Non-Token Daily Missions

- ~3% return in universal ammo
- Rewards: Blazar, Nova, Skill Pills (chance), Ares Rings (chance)
- "Pain in the ass" but worth it for markup opportunities

### Next Island Dailies (Advanced)

- ~5% TT return (best available)
- **Major Drawback**: No market on NI
- Requires: Bankroll, warp ship back to Calypso, TT losses or multiple trips
- Legacy strategy: Herb box farming (no longer primary method)

## General Beginner Advice

### Mentor Recommendations

- Target mobs: 1-1.5k HP range for eco/markup efficiency
- Globals: Achieved through biggest, fattest mob with most DPS
- Consistency: Accumulates over time with proper setup
- Community building needed for player retention

### Mindset on Profitability

- Can't simultaneously want swirlies (globals) AND avoid losses
- Best approach: Accept breakeven/small loss for hunting enjoyment
- Focus on markup efficiency to minimize bleed

### Graduation Path

- New player mentor bonus: Hunter Mentor Edition item
- Different armor rewards per graduation planet
- Worth pursuing for free items

## Misc Tips

### Weapon Progress

- LR-15 leveling path viable
- Longu at Notus good progression target

### Market Opportunities

- Used low-markup extenders as resale (buy TT, resell marked up)
- Leverage market psychology for profit
- Watch forum prices vs NPC TT

### Historical Context

- Pre-Cryengine era: Simpler economy, no mob level display
- 2007 Economy: 700p snable drop was considered hook-worthy
- Old systems had ATH (All Time High) globals that motivated new players
- Gaming has declined since peak, even with improvements

---

## Community & Knowledge Gap

### Key Observation

- **No consolidated guides** (Alice inactive for years)
- Information scattered across forums, Discord, word-of-mouth
- Mentor expressed interest in creating centralized beginner guide website
- Mentor has web development background (can build site in 15 mins)
- Content assembly needed first (no time constraint)

### Contact Info

- Mentor name: Unknown (Discord same as in-game)
- Student: eatfire (Discord), Rubi Bix Cube (in-game)
- Personal motivation: Playing partly in honor of deceased best friend
- Goal: Open store with friend's name to memorialize in-game

## Summary of Key Takeaways

1. **Loot System Penalties** heavily affect new players without looter/efficiency
2. **Equipment Strategy** should focus on markup-efficient options, not UL early
3. **Skilling** focused on low HP/Level mobs; graduation achievable in ~1.5-2k PED
4. **Daily Missions** worth 3-5% return but require discipline
5. **Market Knowledge** critical - understand resale dynamics before investing
6. **Community** needs formalized guides - knowledge gap is real problem
7. **Long-term** games aren't profitable but can be breakeven with smart loadout choices
